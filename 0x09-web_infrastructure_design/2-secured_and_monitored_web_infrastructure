        The firewalls serve the purpose of safeguarding the network from unauthorized users by blocking incoming traffic that meets specific criteria, acting as a mediator between the internal and external network, and providing protection to web servers. SSL certificates are implemented to encrypt the communication between web servers and external networks, protecting against MITM attacks and network sniffers, ensuring privacy, integrity, and identification. Monitoring clients have the function of analyzing server performance and operations, measuring overall health, and alerting administrators if there are issues or the servers are underperforming. The monitoring tool also checks for accessibility, response time, and alerts for any errors, including corrupt or missing files, security vulnerabilities or violations, and many other issues.

        However, there are several issues with this infrastructure. One such issue is terminating SSL at the load balancer level, which leaves the traffic between the load balancer and web servers unencrypted. Another issue is having a single MySQL server that cannot be scaled and could act as a single point of failure for the web infrastructure. Finally, having servers with identical components could cause contention for resources like CPU, memory, and I/O, leading to poor performance and making it difficult to identify the source of the problem. This setup is also not easily scalable.
